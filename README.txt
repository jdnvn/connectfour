Connect Four by Joe Donovan and TJ Goldblatt

Our Connect Four Project utilizes a 2D array to create a Game Board that allows the user to compete with an AI. The user is able to choose to either go first or second with a 1 or 2, and the program is able to prevent user error if the user selects a different option. Next, the user is prompted to choose a column on the board to place their piece and again, the program is able to prevent against user error to ensure the user only chooses between columns A through G. In response to the users input, the AI will analyze the board by checking all possible solutions in each column. It first checks if it can win anywhere, if it cannot, it checks if it can block a potential winning move from the user. If there is nowhere on the board where it can win or block, it places a piece in the nearest location of one of its own pieces. If all else fails, or if it is the starting move of the game, it chooses a column from an array of jumbled column choices. We have another edge case that prevents the user from placing a board piece in a column that is full, if the user tries to do so, an error message is printed and the user is informed to try a different column. As the game continues, eventually a winner is found, or there is a draw if the board is filled. Once there is a connect four, the winner is announced and a list of all moves made during the game is printed at the end.
